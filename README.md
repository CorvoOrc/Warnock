# Warnock

This is my implementation Warnock algorithm.
Warnock algorithm is a hidden surface algorithm 
used in computer graphics. 

It solves the problem of rendering a complicated image 
by recursive subdivision of a scene until areas 
are obtained that are trivial to compute.

Complex: O(n*p), where n is the number of polygons 
and p is the number of pixels in the viewport
